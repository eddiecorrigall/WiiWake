WiiWake
=======

Base code for Wake-On-LAN (WOL) application for Nintendo Wii.

If you have installed Homebrew, you want to boot a network computer remotely, and you have some programming smarts, then this bit of code will be helpful to start your own WOL application.

I think I used devkitPPC. Good luck!
